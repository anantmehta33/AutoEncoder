# Autoencoder-Based Project

This project implements an autoencoder neural network for dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction. Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models designed to learn efficient encodings of input data and reconstruct the input from these encodings. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how autoencoders can compress data and then reconstruct it with minimal loss.

## Introduction

Autoencoders are neural networks designed to replicate their input by learning a compressed representation of data, known as the bottleneck layer. In this project, we build an autoencoder using PyTorch to compress images and then reconstruct them from their compressed form.

The autoencoder is trained using the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. This project includes code for:
- Building and training the autoencoder.
- Visualizing the performance by plotting the loss curve.
- Visualizing original and reconstructed images.
